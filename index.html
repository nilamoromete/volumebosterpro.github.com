    <h1>Privacy Policy for Volume Booster Pro</h1>
    <p>Last updated: [Current Date]</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>Volume Booster Pro is designed with user privacy in mind. We are committed to being transparent about our data handling practices:</p>

        <li>Local storage for saving user preferences (volume levels and equalizer settings)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Handle Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All audio processing is performed locally in your browser</li>
        <li>No audio content is recorded, stored, or transmitted</li>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
